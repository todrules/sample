# Sample project

### Built With

* Angular 5.2.0
* TypeScript
* Nodejs

## Features 

Built with Angular. I'm using my own UI library and themer and my own Flex layout CSS, so there are no dependencies on Angular Material or Angular Flex-Layout.

### Login

No username or password are required. Only need to click the button to be let in.

### Dashboard

Examples using AmCharts.

### Themes

Theme selector. Will change the entire color scheme not only for buttons, but also background colors, chart colors, etc...
Changes every page, too.

### Resume

Shows a different design style.

### Home

This is my design for a one-page style type website.

#### Notes

If you view this app, please use in Chrome. This was also an experiment using custom CSS properties, to be able to use "variables" in an actual CSS file and not just in a preprocessor.
That being said, MS (IE & Edge) have bugs using custom CSS properties in a CSS calc statement, so this site will not render properly using those browsers.

```

 h1 {
   line-height: calc(var(--h1-adjust) * 1.1);
 }
 ```

Also, except for the charts, all the UI I created myself - no UI libraries.

Hopefully, this project shows a little of my coding style, as well as my UI design style and knowledge of the various libraries and frameworks.
